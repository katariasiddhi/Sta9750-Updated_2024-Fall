    "text": "The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is important for reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change. However, widespread adoption faces numerous barriers, with charging costs and infrastructure accessibility standing out as critical factors. Regional disparities in charging costs, coupled with the availability of residential versus commercial charging options, play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and choices regarding EV adoption.\nThis report investigates the average cost of EV charging across different regions and examines how the distribution of residential and commercial charging stations influences EV adoption rates. Using datasets related to EV populations, charging stations, and registration activities, this analysis seeks to uncover actionable insights into the challenges and opportunities for promoting EV adoption."

Where direct cost data was unavailable, proxies were created using station type and regional data."

Since direct pricing data was not available, proxy variables such as station type and regional characteristics were used to infer cost differences. Regional groupings were established to identify patterns and disparities.\n\n\n2. Residential vs. Commercial Charging Station Distribution\nThe availability of residential and commercial charging stations was mapped by region using the “Electric_Vehicle_Charging_Stations_Data.csv” data set. Proportions of station types were calculated to identify regions with significant imbalances in infrastructure.\n\n\n3. Correlation with EV Adoption\nTo evaluate the impact of infrastructure on adoption rates, EV registration data from the “Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data_set.csv” and “Electric_Vehicle_Title_and_Registration_Activity.csv” datasets was analyzed alongside charging station distribution. A correlation analysis was performed to determine the strength of relationships between station type availability and adoption rates."

    "text": "Insights Based on the Visuals:\n\nCommercial Charging Stations vs. Electric Range:\n\nThe scatter plot with trend lines shows a weak negative correlation. This suggests that the number of commercial charging stations does not significantly impact the average electric range.\n\nResidential vs. Commercial Charging Stations by City:\n\nCities with more residential charging stations (e.g., Fairfield, Middletown) tend to have higher infrastructure availability overall compared to cities with primarily commercial stations. This may indicate that residential stations play a bigger role in supporting EV adoption.\n\nAverage Electric Range by City:\n\nSome cities (e.g., Mystic, Washington) have significantly higher average electric ranges, possibly because they cater to a larger proportion of long-range EVs or due to socioeconomic factors.\n\nAverage Charging Cost by City:\n\nCities like Fairfield and Mystic show higher average charging costs. This cost disparity may reflect differences in infrastructure quality, electricity rates, or station types.\n\nCharging Cost vs. Charging Infrastructure:\n\nThe scatter plot indicates a weak positive correlation between average charging cost and total charging stations. Regions with higher infrastructure availability may have higher overall costs due to commercial charging stations."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe findings underscore the critical role of charging infrastructure in overcoming EV adoption barriers. Lower charging costs in regions with abundant residential stations appear to alleviate consumer concerns, whereas reliance on commercial stations may deter potential adopters due to higher costs.\nPolicymakers and stakeholders should prioritize expanding residential charging networks, especially in urban areas where such options are scarce. This could involve incentivizing property developers to integrate EV charging infrastructure into new residential projects or subsidizing installation costs for homeowners.\nHowever, the analysis faced limitations. The lack of direct pricing data required reliance on proxy measures, which may not fully capture real-world charging costs. Additionally, external factors such as local electricity rates and government incentives were not included but likely influence adoption patterns."

Expanding residential charging networks and addressing regional cost disparities are critical steps to accelerate the transition to EVs. Future research should incorporate direct pricing data and explore the role of policy interventions in shaping infrastructure development.\nThank you for sharing the outputs of the analyses.
